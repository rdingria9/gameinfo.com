Battlefield is a series of first-person shooter video games that started out on Microsoft Windows and OS X with its debut video game, Battlefield 1942, which was released in 2002. The series is developed by Swedish company EA Digital Illusions CE and is published by American company Electronic Arts. The series features a greater focus on large maps, teamwork and vehicle warfare than traditional first-person shooters. The PC games in the series are mainly focused on online multiplayer. The Battlefield series has served more than 50 million players worldwide as of 2012, across 11 games and 12 expansion packs released since its inception in 2007. The series has a recognizable 6-beat sting.

Battlefield 1942 was released on September 10, 2002, using the Refractor gaming engine, and introduced the "Conquest" gameplay mode, in which players fought for "capture points" throughout the map. Two expansion packs were released, The Road to Rome and Secret Weapons of WWII.
Battlefield Vietnam, released in 2004, moved the setting to the Vietnam War, and was built on a modified Refractor engine with various gameplay improvements, such as firing personal weapons while seated in vehicles.
The 2005 game Battlefield 2 takes place in the modern day, during a fictional war between the United States, China, and the fictional Middle Eastern Coalition (MEC). Despite it requiring numerous software patches due to the large number of bugs and glitches in the game upon its release, it was a commercial success, selling over 2,250,000 copies worldwide, as of July 2006.[52] One expansion pack, Special Forces, and two booster packs, Armored Fury and Euro Force, were also released. A version of the game called Battlefield 2: Modern Combat was released for consoles, with an improved single player mode but more limited online play.<br>

Battlefield 2142 was released in 2006, taking place during a global ice age in the 22nd century. While much of it is graphically similar to Battlefield 2, it introduced a variety of equippable items to unlock and battles between two giant "Titan" airships. Its use of in-game advertising was controversial among players.[53] The Northern Strike booster pack was later released, including new maps, vehicles, and a new game mode.
Battlefield: Bad Company, released in 2008, followed the infamous "B" Company's AWOL escapades and their search for mercenary gold. This new, modern day Battlefield game had modern day weapons, as well as a variety of vehicles for land, air and sea. It had a remarkably realistic destruction system that allowed the player to break, destroy, or create new environments, based on a new next generation gaming engine named Frostbite.
In 2009, EA released two download-only games, Battlefield Heroes, a free-to-play Refractor 2 engine game, supported by advertising and micropayments and Battlefield 1943, a Frostbite engine game, released in July 2009, for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and was scheduled for release in Q1 2010, for PCs, but was cancelled.[54]
In 2010, a direct sequel to Battlefield: Bad Company, Battlefield: Bad Company 2, was released, involving "B" Company's search for an EMP weapon (called a scalar weapon ingame). It had a larger, and arguably better multiplayer than its predecessor "Bad Company", with updated graphics and new realistic effects (e.g. bullet-drop). It also featured a "VIP" system of content distribution where player with VIP codes gain free access to new maps released periodically. DICE also released an expansion for Bad Company 2, Battlefield: Bad Company 2: Vietnam.<br>

Battlefield 3 was announced in 2009,[55][56] and in 2010 it was confirmed that gamers who pre-ordered Medal of Honor (2010) Limited Edition or who pre-ordered from origin (in the U.S. only) would receive beta access to Battlefield 3 48 hours before the open beta was released. On February 4, 2011, the first teaser trailer for the game was revealed, with a preliminary release in the Fall of 2011.[57] Among the features that remain in the game are Jets and the ability to go prone. The game still allows 64 (on the PC) players as in all previous Battlefield titles, though the consoles allow for 24 player matches. The Battlefield 3 Beta was released on September 29, 2011.[58] Battlefield 3 was released on October 25, 2011 and has received almost unanimous high review scores and has received awards from IGN.
On November 5, 2010, EASY Studios announced a follow-up to its free-to-play Battlefield Heroes, Battlefield Play4Free. EASY develops the free-to-play variants of Battlefield. Its latest offering gives players the same free-to-play pricing structure of Heroes, while still offering a more serious, core Battlefield experience (as opposed to Heroes' lighthearted, cartoon-styled environment).[59] Battlefield Play4Free went into open beta on April 4, 2011.<br>

On July 17, 2012, an advertisement appeared on EA's Origin webpage that players who pre-order Medal of Honor: Warfighter, would receive access to an exclusive Battlefield 4 Beta. On March 18th a vine was posted on the official Battlefield Vine account that teased a upcoming trailer. Three videos were posted during the following week named Prepare 4 Battle: Sea, Prepare 4 Battle: Land, Prepare 4 Battle: Air. These were posted on the 21st 22nd and 25th respectively. Battlefield 4 was officially revealed at on March 25, 2013 an event during GDC 2013 in San Francisco and at an event in Stockholm, Sweden a few hours prior with a news embargo in between the events. A 17 minute "Fishing in Baku" trailer was released via the official Battlefield YouTube channel at midnight that day. On June 10th at the E3 2013 expo in Los Angeles, California, a new single player trailer was revealed at Microsoft's Xbox press conference named "Angry Sea". Later that day Battlefield 4's multiplayer component was officially shown off at EA's press conference with 64 players on the stage playing the "Siege of Shanghai" map on the PC in front of a live audience. A multiplayer trailer was released later that day. Many more announcements were made in the following months and during Gamescom 2013. An extremely limited alpha trial took place in June with invitations sent at random to recipients of the Battlefield newsletter. The test was a "whitebox test" with all of the textures, and took place on the map siege of Shanghai for two weeks. A beta took place on October 1-15, with exclusive period for the first three days for those that pre-ordered Medal of Honor: Warfighter, bought Battlefield 4 digital deluxe edition, or were premium members in Battlefield 3. Battlefield 4 was released on October 29th in North America, and on November 1st for the rest of the world. With releases for the Playstation 4 and Xbox one on the 15th and 22nd respectively.<br>
